## Introduction

We have two gerrit instances: Chromium OS and the (internal) Chrome OS gerrit
instance.

For the Chromium OS instance: This is where most of the development happens. You
do not have to be an "official" Chromium contributor or Googler or anything else
to interact with the Chromium OS gerrit instance and/or upload changes to it. We
restrict access by only allowing certain people to *approve* changes before
they're allowed to go into the main tree.

For the internal Chrome OS instance: Access is restricted to Googlers and
partners with a '&lt;partner&gt;.corp-partner.google.com' email address.

The gerrit instance for Chromium OS and Chrome OS uses Google Accounts to
provide authentication. This means any account you can use to log into
google.com can also be used to authenticate with Gerrit.

### (EVERYONE) To get access to the Chromium Gerrit instance

Follow the steps in [Chromium's Gerrit Guide](/developers/gerrit-guide).

### (Googlers & Partners) To get access to the internal Chrome Gerrit instance

1.  You must also do the steps above for your @chromium.org account first
2.  Go to <https://google.com/> and verify you are logged into your
            @google.com account
3.  Set up your account on Gerrit by visiting
    <https://chrome-internal-review.googlesource.com/>. Make sure you are logged
    into your @google.com or corp-partner account.

**For Googlers:**

1.  Ensure that `repo` authenticates to chromium and chrome-internal using
    the corp SSO protocol. This is required to recognise you as a Googler
    and will only work from a Google corp machine:
    ```
    git config --global --replace-all url.sso://chromium.insteadOf https://chromium.googlesource.com
    git config --global --add url.sso://chromium.insteadOf https://chromium-review.googlesource.com
    git config --global --replace-all url.sso://chrome-internal.insteadOf https://chrome-internal.googlesource.com
    git config --global --add url.sso://chrome-internal.insteadOf https://chrome-internal-review.googlesource.com
    ```
2.  Run `gcert` once a day to authenticate your account.
3.  **Verification:** Run
    `git ls-remote https://chrome-internal.googlesource.com/chromeos/manifest-internal.git`

**For Partners:**

1.  Load <https://www.googlesource.com/new-password>
    1.  **Make sure you are logged into your corp-partner account.**
    2.  **You can verify this by ensuring that the Username field looks
                like git-&lt;user&gt;corp-partner.google.com**
3.  Follow the directions on the new-password page to append to your
    .gitcookies file.
4.  **Verification:** Find a repo in your local manifest and run `git
    ls-remote https://chrome-internal.googlesource.com/<REPO_PATH>.git` -
    Example: `git ls-remote
    https://chrome-internal.googlesource.com/chromeos/overlays/chromeos-partner-overlay.git`
    Note that this should **not** prompt for any credentials, and should just
    print out a list of git references.

### (Googler) Link @chromium.org & @google.com accounts

Follow the steps in [Chromium's Gerrit Guide](/developers/gerrit-guide). You
must link your accounts to have proper access in Gerrit.
