#

When debugging code, it can often be useful to have a reference for constants
and their symbolic names.
There are a variety of sources available on the internet, some good, many bad.
Most of them focus on x86 only which makes working with other architectures
difficult.

Note that these tables are not hand maintained.
If you wish to update/refresh them, use the associated scripts.

* [errnos](./errnos/): Your standard errno table.
* [signals](./signals/): Signal numbers.
* [syscalls](./syscalls/): System call numbers and references.
