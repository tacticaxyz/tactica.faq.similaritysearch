### **Build the QUIC client and server**

A sample server and client implementation are provided in Chromium, and several
more are provided as part of QUICHE. To use these
you should first have [checked out the Chromium
source](/developers/how-tos/get-the-code), and then build the binaries:

```none
ninja -C out/Debug quic_server quic_client
```

Binary targets include:

 * `quic_server` - a QUIC server for testing purposes defined in
   `//net/tools/quic/quic_simple_server_bin.cc`. This binary supports proxying,
   but that support has bugs.

 * `quic_client` - a QUIC client defined in
   `//net/tools/quic/quic_simple_client_bin.cc`.

 * `epoll_quic_server` - a QUIC server defined in QUICHE. This is similar to
   `quic_server` but supports proxying via CONNECT, including CONNECT-UDP. This
   only works on Linux, as it uses `epoll(7)`.

 * `epoll_quic_client` - a QUIC client defined in QUICHE. This only works on
   Linux, as it uses `epoll(7)`.

 * `masque_server` - a server defined in QUICHE which only allows proxying via
   MASQUE (CONNECT-UDP, CONNECT-IP, or CONNECT-ETHERNET). Note that
   `masque_server` does not support plain `CONNECT` tunnels.

 * `masque_client` - a client defined in QUICHE which can either fetch URLs via
   QUIC in a CONNECT-UDP tunnel, or connect a `tun` (CONNECT-IP) or `tap`
   (CONNECT-ETHERNET) tunnel.

### **Prep test data from www.example.org**

The server implementations support serving data cached on disk. The data is in
the format written by `wget -p --save-headers`.

To download a copy of `www.example.org`:

```none
mkdir /tmp/quic-data
cd /tmp/quic-data
wget -p --save-headers https://www.example.org
```

Manually edit index.html and adjust the headers:

 * **Remove (if it exists):** `Transfer-Encoding: chunked`
 * **Remove (if it exists):** `Alternate-Protocol: ...`
 * **Add:** `X-Original-Url: https://www.example.org/`

### Generate certificates

In order to run the server, you will need a valid certificate, and a private key
in pkcs8 format. If you don't have one, there are scripts you can use to
generate them:

```none
cd net/tools/quic/certs
./generate-certs.sh
cd -
```

These generate a certificate and key for `www.example.org` in
`net/tools/quic/certs/out`, good for only three days.

In addition to the server's certificate and public key, this script will also
generate a CA certificate (`net/tools/quic/certs/out/2048-sha256-root.pem`)
which you will need to add to your OS's root certificate store in order for it
to be trusted during certificate validation. For doing this on Linux, please see
[these
instructions](https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromium/src/+/HEAD/docs/linux/cert_management.md).
This will allow `quic_client` to verify the certificate correctly.

Note that Chrome/Chromium (the browser) does not allow custom CAs for
QUIC, so _in addition_ to adding the root certificate to the certificate store,
you'll need to pass in `--ignore-certificate-errors-spki-list=..` with the
certificate's SPKI to allow Chrome/Chromium to accept your custom certificate as
valid.

You can generate the SPKI with:

```shell
openssl x509 -noout -pubkey < net/tools/quic/certs/out/leaf_cert.pem | \
    openssl rsa -pubin -outform der | \
    openssl dgst -sha256 -binary | \
    openssl enc -base64
```

### Run the QUIC server and client with cached data

Run the `quic_server`, pointing to the cached `www.example.org` content
and cert/key generated above:

```none
./out/Debug/quic_server \
  --quic_response_cache_dir=/tmp/quic-data/www.example.org \
  --certificate_file=net/tools/quic/certs/out/leaf_cert.pem \
  --key_file=net/tools/quic/certs/out/leaf_cert.pkcs8
```

And you should be able to successfully request the file over QUIC using
`quic_client`:

```none
./out/Debug/quic_client --host=127.0.0.1 --port=6121 https://www.example.org/
```

Note that if you let the server's port default to 6121, you must specify the
client port because it defaults to 80.

Moreover, if your local machine has multiple loopback addresses (as it would if
using both IPv4 and IPv6), you have to pick a specific address.

It remains to be determined whether the latter shortcoming is a bug.

If the server you are connecting to does not have a trusted certificate, use the
`--disable_certificate_verification` flag on the client to disable certificate
verification. If the server's certificate is trusted but chains to a user
installed CA (e.g. a CA generated by the script mentioned above), use the
`--allow_unknown_root_cert` flag on the client to allow connections where the
cert chains to a user installed CA.

**note: both the client and server are meant mainly for integration testing:
neither is performant at scale!**

To test the same download using chrome,

```none
chrome \
  --user-data-dir=/tmp/chrome-profile \
  --no-proxy-server \
  --enable-quic \
  --origin-to-force-quic-on=www.example.org:443 \
  --host-resolver-rules='MAP www.example.org:443 127.0.0.1:6121' \
  https://www.example.org
```

Note that the server's certificate must be trusted by a default CA for
Chrome/Chromium to accept it for QUIC. If you are using a self-signed
certificate or a certificate that is signed by a custom CA, you need to use the
`--ignore-certificate-errors-spki-list` command line flag to trust an individual
certificate based on its SPKI. It is not possible to trust a custom CA using this
flag. If you wish to deploy a MITM proxy that intercepts traffic, you need to
block QUIC entirely and intercept TLS instead.

### Proxying Requests

To set up proxying with `CONNECT`:

```none
./out/Default/epoll_quic_server \
    --mode=proxy \
    --connect_proxy_destinations=google.com:443 \
    --certificate_file=net/tools/quic/certs/out/leaf_cert.pem \
    --key_file=net/tools/quic/certs/out/leaf_cert.pkcs8
```

and, ensuring you've added the root cert to the cert store and put the leaf
cert's SPKI in $SPKI,

```none
out/Default/chrome \
    --user-data-dir=/tmp/chrome-profile \
    --host-resolver-rules='MAP www.example.org 127.0.0.1' \
    --proxy-server=quic://www.example.org:6121 \
    --origin-to-force-quic-on=www.example.org:6121 \
    --ignore-certificate-errors \
    --ignore-certificate-errors-spki-list="${SPKI}"
```

Note that all of `--ignore-cerificate-errors`,
`--ignore-certificate-errors-spki-list`, and
[`--origin-to-force-quic-on`](https://bugs.chromium.org/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=980654#c3) are
required, along with the root cert in the cert store, to avoid certificate
validation errors.

### **Troubleshooting**

If you run into troubles, try running the server or client with --v=1. It will
increase the logging verbosity and the additional logs will often help expose
the underlying problem.
