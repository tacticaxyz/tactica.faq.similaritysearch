You can test Chrome builds or Chromium builds. Chrome builds have the most
infrastructure for analyzing crashes and reporting bugs. They also auto-update as new
releases occur, which makes them a good choice for most uses.
[Chrome Canary](https://www.google.com/chrome/canary) is available for Windows
and Mac and autoupdates daily.
[Other channels](/getting-involved/chrome-release-channels/) (Dev
and Beta) are available.

[Chrome for Testing](https://developer.chrome.com/blog/chrome-for-testing/) builds and
Chromium builds do not auto-update, and do not have symbols. This makes them most
useful for checking whether a claimed fix actually works. Use the following
instructions to find builds.

## Chrome for Testing

Chrome for Testing is a dedicated flavor of Chrome targeting the testing use case,
without auto-update, integrated into the Chrome release process, made available for
every Chrome release across all channels (Stable/Beta/Dev/Canary).

The easiest way to download Chrome for Testing binaries for your platform is by using
[the `@puppeteer/browsers` command-line utility](https://pptr.dev/browsers-api),
available via `npm`. Here are some examples:

```sh
# Download the latest available Chrome for Testing binary corresponding to the Stable channel.
npx @puppeteer/browsers install chrome@stable

# Download a specific Chrome for Testing version.
npx @puppeteer/browsers install chrome@116.0.5793.0

# Download the latest available ChromeDriver version corresponding to the Canary channel.
npx @puppeteer/browsers install chromedriver@canary

# Download a specific ChromeDriver version.
npx @puppeteer/browsers install chromedriver@116.0.5793.0
```

If you prefer to build your own automated scripts for downloading these binaries,
refer to
[the JSON API endpoints](https://github.com/GoogleChromeLabs/chrome-for-testing#json-api-endpoints)
with the latest available versions per Chrome release channel (Stable, Beta, Dev,
Canary).

To get a quick overview of the latest status, consult
[the Chrome for Testing availability dashboard](https://googlechromelabs.github.io/chrome-for-testing/).

## Chromium

In contrast to Chrome for Testing builds, Chromium builds are made available on a
best-effort basis, and are built from arbitrary revisions that donâ€™t necessarily
map to user-facing Chrome releases.

### Easy Point and Click for latest build:

> Open up <https://download-chromium.appspot.com>

### Easy Script to download and run latest Linux build:

*   <https://github.com/scheib/chromium-latest-linux>

### Not-as-easy steps:

1.  Head to
            <https://commondatastorage.googleapis.com/chromium-browser-snapshots/index.html>
2.  Choose your platform: Mac, Win, Linux, ChromiumOS
3.  Pick the Chromium build number you'd like to use
    1.  The latest one is mentioned in the `LAST_CHANGE` file
4.  Download the zip file containing Chromium
5.  There is a binary executable within to run

### Please [file bugs](https://crbug.com/new) as appropriate.

## Downloading old builds of Chrome / Chromium

Let's say you want a build of Chrome 44 for debugging purposes. Google does not
offer old builds as they do not have up-to-date security fixes.

However, you can get a build of Chromium 44.x which should mostly match the
stable release.

Here's how you find it:

1.  Look in
            <https://googlechromereleases.blogspot.com/search/label/Stable%20updates>
            for the last time "44." was mentioned.
2.  Loop up that version history ("44.0.2403.157") in the [Position
            Lookup](https://omahaproxy.appspot.com/)
3.  In this case it returns a base position of "330231". This is the
            commit of where the 44 release was branched, back in May 2015.\*
4.  Open the [continuous builds
            archive](https://commondatastorage.googleapis.com/chromium-browser-snapshots/index.html)
5.  Click through on your platform (Linux/Mac/Win)
6.  Paste "330231" into the filter field at the top and wait for all the
            results to XHR in.
7.  Eventually I get a perfect hit:
            <https://commondatastorage.googleapis.com/chromium-browser-snapshots/index.html?prefix=Mac/330231/>
    1.  Sometimes you may have to decrement the commit number until you
                find one.
8.  Download and run!

\* As this build was made at 44 branch point, it does not have any commits
merged in while in beta.

Typically that's OK, but if you need a true build of "44.0.*2403*.x" then you'll
need to build Chromium from the *2403* branch. Some
PortableApps/PortableChromium sites offer binaries like this, due to security
concerns, the Chrome team does not recommend running them.
