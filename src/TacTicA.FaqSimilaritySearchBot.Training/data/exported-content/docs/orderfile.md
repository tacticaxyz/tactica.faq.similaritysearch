# Orderfile

An orderfile is a list of symbols that defines an ordering of functions. One can
make a static linker, such as LLD, respect this ordering when generating a
binary.

Reordering code this way can improve startup performance by fetching machine
code to memory more efficiently, since it requires fetching fewer pages from
disk, and a big part of the I/O work is done sequentially by the readahead.

Code reordering can also improve memory usage by keeping the used code in a
smaller number of memory pages. It can also reduce TLB and L1i cache misses by
placing functions commonly called together closely in memory.

## Generating Orderfiles Manually

To generate an orderfile you can run the `generate_orderfile_full.py`
script. You will need an Android device connected with
[adb](https://developer.android.com/tools/adb) to generate the orderfile as the
generation pipeline will need to run benchmarks on a device. The script will
automatically verify the generated orderfile at the end of the process.

Example:

```
tools/cygprofile/generate_orderfile_full.py --target-arch=arm64 --use-remoteexec
```

You can specify the architecture (arm or arm64) with `--target-arch`. For quick
local testing you can use `--streamline-for-debugging`. To build using Reclient,
use `--use-remoteexec` (Googlers only). There are several other options you can
use to configure/debug the orderfile generation. Use the `-h` option to view the
various options.

NB: If your checkout is non-internal you must use the `--public` option.

To build Chrome with a locally generated orderfile, use the
`chrome_orderfile_path=<path_to_orderfile>` GN arg.

To verify that an orderfile is valid for a given build, you can use the
`check_orderfile.py` script. This is useful to ensure that the orderfile
is compatible with the version of the library you are building.

Example:

```
tools/cygprofile/check_orderfile.py --target-arch=arm64 \
  -C out/Release --orderfile-path=clank/orderfiles/orderfile.arm64.out
```

Alternatively, you can use the `--verify` flag with `generate_orderfile_full.py`
to build and verify in one step.

```



## Orderfile Performance Testing

Orderfiles can be tested using
[Pinpoint](https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromium/src/+/main/docs/speed/perf_trybots.md).
To do this, please create and upload a Gerrit change overriding the value of
[`chrome_orderfile_path`](https://source.chromium.org/chromium/chromium/src/+/main:build/config/compiler/BUILD.gn;l=217-223;drc=3a829695d83990141babd25dee7f2f94c005cae4)
to, for instance, `//path/to/my_orderfile` (relative to `src`), where
`my_orderfile` is the orderfile that needs to be evaluated. The orderfile should
be added to the local branch and uploaded to Gerrit along with
`build/config/compiler/BUILD.gn`. This Gerrit change can then be used as an
"experiment patch" for a Pinpoint try job.

## Triaging Performance Regressions

Occasionally, an orderfile roll will cause performance problems on perfbots.
This typically triggers an alert in the form of a bug report, which contains a
group of related regressions like the one shown
[here](https://crbug.com/344654892).

In such cases it is important to keep in mind that effectiveness of the
orderfile is coupled with using a recent PGO profile when building the native
code. As a result some orderfile improvements (or effective no-ops) register as
regressions on perfbots using non-PGO builds, which is the most common perfbot
configuration.

If a new regression does not include alerts from the
[android-pixel6-perf-pgo](https://ci.chromium.org/ui/p/chrome/builders/luci.chrome.ci/android-pixel6-perf-pgo)
(the only Android PGO perfbot as of 2024-06) then the first thing to check is to
query the same benchmark+metric combinations for the PGO bot. If the graphs
demonstrate no regression, feel free to close the issue as WontFix(Intended
Behavior). However, not all benchmarks are exercised on the PGO bot
continuously. If there is no PGO coverage for a particular benchmark+metric
combination, this combination can be checked on Pinpoint with the right perfbot
choice ([example](https://crbug.com/344665295)).

Finally, the PGO+orderfile coupling exists only on arm64. Most speed
optimization efforts on Android are focused on this configuration. On arm32 the
most important orderfile optimization is for reducing memory used by machine
code. Only one benchmark measures it: `system_health.memory_mobile`.

## Orderfile Pipeline

The `generate_orderfile_full.py` script runs several key steps:

1. **Build and install Chrome with orderfile instrumentation.** This uses the
   [`-finstrument-function-entry-bare`](https://clang.llvm.org/docs/ClangCommandLineReference.html#cmdoption-clang-finstrument-function-entry-bare)
   Clang command line option to insert instrumentation for function entry. The
   build will be generated in `out/arm_instrumented_out/` or
   `out/arm64_instrumented_out`, depending on the CPU architecture (instruction
   set).

2. **Run the benchmarks and collect profiles.** These benchmarks can be found in
   [orderfile.py](../tools/perf/contrib/orderfile/orderfile.py). These profiles
   are a list of function offsets into the binary that were called during
   execution of the benchmarks.

3. **Cluster the symbols from the profiles to generate the orderfile.** The
   offsets are processed and merged using a
   [clustering](../tools/cygprofile/cluster.py) algorithm to produce an
   orderfile.

4. **Run benchmarks on the final orderfile.** We run some benchmarks to compare
   the performance with/without the orderfile. You can supply the
   `--no-benchmark` flag to skip this step.

## Official Orderfile Generation

The official orderfiles are generated on CI by dedicated builders. These
builders ensure that the orderfiles used in release builds of Chrome are always
fresh and based on a recent PGO profile. These builders also ensure that the
orderfile and PGO profile are generated at the same Chromium commit and used
together. See https://crbug.com/372686816 for more context.

### The Orderfile Bots

The generation is handled by two builders for Android:

- `android-arm32-orderfile`
- `android-arm64-orderfile`

These builders can be found on the
[chrome.orderfile console](https://ci.chromium.org/p/chrome/g/chrome.orderfile/builders).
They include builders for trunk and the various release branches/milestones.

### Triggering and Dependencies

The orderfile generation process is tightly coupled with
[Profile-Guided Optimization (PGO)](./pgo.md). The orderfile builders are
automatically triggered by their corresponding PGO profile generation builders.
This is configured for the orderfile builders in the `triggered_by` parameter in
the orderfile builder configuration. For example:

- `ci/android-arm32-pgo` triggers `android-arm32-orderfile`.
- `ci/android-arm64-pgo` triggers `android-arm64-orderfile`.

This ensures that the orderfile is always generated using the most recent PGO
profile and at the same Chromium commit, which is crucial for its effectiveness.
The PGO profile provides the necessary data to determine which functions are
used most frequently and in what order, forming the basis for the clustering
algorithm that generates the final orderfile. The PGO builder passes the GCS
file path and name of the new profile to the orderfile builder so that the
orderfile builder can download it, as it has not yet been rolled into trunk at
this point.

### Builder Configuration

The configuration for these builders is defined in
[`//internal/infra/config/subprojects/chrome/ci/chrome.orderfile.star`](https://source.corp.google.com/h/chromium/chromium/src/+/main:internal/infra/config/subprojects/chrome/ci/chrome.orderfile.star).
This configuration specifies the build steps, target architecture, and other
parameters. The builders run the
[`generate_orderfile.py`](../tools/cygprofile/generate_orderfile.py) script,
which orchestrates the process described in the "Orderfile Pipeline" section
above.

For questions or issues with the orderfile builders, the point of contact is
`orderfile-discuss@google.com`.
