# Technically speaking, what makes Google Chrome fast? (Part II)
- **Published**: 2010-04-14T10:58:00.000-07:00
If you’ve dug around the many graphs that are displayed when you type “about:histograms” into Chrome’s Omnibox, you’ll notice that we’re still obsessed about measuring, benchmarking, and improving speed and performance on the browser.   
  
Previously, we [published a series of video interviews](http://blog.chromium.org/2009/12/technically-speaking-what-makes-google.html) on several key engineering pieces that go into designing a fast, responsive modern browser, namely [DNS pre-resolution](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FhDDwmOyRmk), the [V8 JavaScript engine](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KTkTBKSnqbA), and [DOM bindings](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8QRTkPrFbVQ).  
  
In this next installment of technical interviews on Chrome’s speed, we’ll dive into two more areas that contribute to Chrome’s speed: UI responsiveness and WebKit.   
  
**WebKit**  
with James Robinson  
  
  
  
1. What is WebKit?   
2. How does WebKit contribute to Chrome's speed?  
3. Tell us more about current and future work on WebKit and Chrome  
4. Tell us more about new WebKit APIs that can further improve performance  
5. What are the challenges of developing a new API for the web?  
6. Tell us more about optimizing performance hotspots in WebKit, such as strings and repainting  
  
  
**UI responsiveness**  
with Peter Kasting  
  
  
  
1. What is UI responsiveness?  
2. What are examples of UI responsiveness in Chrome?  
3. How does multi-threading improve UI responsiveness?  
4. Tell us about how the backing store cache improves UI responsiveness?  
5. How do you benchmark UI responsiveness?  
6. How does Chrome's simplicity contribute to a responsive UI experience?  
7. What are future plans to further improve UI responsiveness?  
8. What motivates you to work on UI responsiveness?
