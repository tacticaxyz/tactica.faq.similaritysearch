Today we're announcing an important update to the [previously communicated](https://blog.chromium.org/2020/08/changes-to-chrome-app-support-timeline.html) Chrome app support timeline. Based on feedback from our Enterprise and Education customers and partners, we have made the decision to extend [Chrome app](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/apps/) support for those users on Chrome OS until at least January 2025.Â 

We continue to invest and have made significant progress in rich new capabilities on the Web platform with [Progressive Web Apps (PWA)](https://web.dev/what-are-pwas/), and we recommend that Chrome app developers migrate to PWAs as soon as possible. PWAs are built and enhanced with [modern APIs](https://fugu-tracker.web.app/) to deliver enhanced capabilities, reliability, and installability while reaching anyone, anywhere, on any device with a single codebase. There is a growing ecosystem of powerful desktop web apps & PWAs, from advanced graphics products like Adobe Spark to engaging media apps like YouTube TV to productivity and collaboration apps like Zoom.

For additional support with Chrome app migration, please visit our [Web apps on Chrome OS page](https://chromeos.dev/en/web). This page will be kept up to date as we progress together through this process.

We thank our community of developers who have provided feedback to help us shape this modified and simplified approach. We are inspired by a future beyond Chrome apps, where the ecosystem continues forward progress leveraging open Web standards across all modern browsers.
