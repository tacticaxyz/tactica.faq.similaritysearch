# Globetrotting with Google Chrome Extensions and HTML5
- **Published**: 2010-05-06T20:39:00.000-07:00
The Google Chrome Developer Relations team has been working hard to spread the word about Google Chrome’s extensions platform and support for HTML5. Besides speaking at developer events around Silicon Valley, we’ve made it a priority to connect with developers in other locations in and out of the United States.  
  
Following [our trips last year](http://blog.chromium.org/2010/02/extending-google-chrome-25621-miles.html) to the Czech Republic, Russia, and Argentina, we spent a good chunk of the past few months on the road meeting with hundreds of developers and [Google Technology User Groups](http://www.gtugs.org/).

For starters, Brian Kennish spoke about [advanced extensions](http://docs.google.com/a/google.com/present/view?id=ddr8dvqs_38gwvbh6d5) at Google DevFest in Tokyo, Japan and Google’s South by Southwest Interactive booth in Austin, Texas. You can check out a [video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=la4sIw-G4Kc) of Brian’s DevFest session.  
  
Next, Ernest Delgado, Jeremy Orlow, and Arne Roomann-Kurrik presented extensions and HTML5 to developers in London, England. Both presentations were actually implemented using HTML5 — the [extensions deck as an extension](http://code.google.com/p/crx-presentation/) and the [HTML5 deck as a webpage](http://code.google.com/p/html5-slides/).  
  
Ernest and Arne went on to deliver this content to developers in Spain, Germany, and the Czech Republic. Here’s a [video](http://brno.gug.cz/2010/04/video-z-hackathonu-gratulace-vitezum.html) of the talk they gave to the Brno, Czech Republic Google User Group.

We love to help developers get their “hands dirty” with code too, so the team organized several hackathons during these trips. Brian led a [hackathon in Sydney, Australia](https://wave.google.com/wave/#restored:wave:googlewave.com!w%252BRNGw8TtHA) and [another in Austin](http://www.bazaarvoice.com/blog/2010/03/30/bv-labs-engineer-takes-top-prize-at-sxswi-google-hackathon/), where developers built lots of great extensions. Meanwhile, Ernest and Arne led students through building extensions at universities in Madrid and Brno.  
  
We’re keen to continue connecting with developer communities around the world. If we haven’t visited a location near you yet, we hope the resources above come in handy. And for those of you who want the thrill of a hackathon experience, our friends at Twilio recently launched an [online extensions hackathon](http://contests.twilio.com/) with awesome prizes. We look forward to trying out what you create.  
  
Keep an eye on this blog for future announcements and event plans. We won’t be traveling for the next couple weeks as we prepare new content for [Google I/O](http://code.google.com/events/io/2010/), but perhaps some of you will be making trips of your own to see us there!
