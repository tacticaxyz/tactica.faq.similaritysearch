The Unified Consent component contains the browser keyed service that
manages user consent when the Unified Consent feature is enabled. It also
holds the prefs and the APIs allowing the various Chromium features to verify if
the user has given consent for a given feature.

The component is used on all platforms (desktop, ChromeOS, Android and iOS).
