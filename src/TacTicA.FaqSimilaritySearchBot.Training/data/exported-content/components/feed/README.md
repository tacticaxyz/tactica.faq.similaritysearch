# Feed Component

The Feed component provides a cross-platform implementation of many components
used in the Discover Feed (shown on the NTP).

Primary responsibilities:
* Fetching, loading and persisting Feed content.
* Sending actions
* Recording metrics
* Configuration of WebFeeds

Note that 'v2' is now the only Feed implementation available.
