# Hello, open source developers. Would you like to help build an operating system for web users?
- **Published**: 2009-11-19T08:56:00.000-08:00
Today we announced the Chromium OS project on the [Official Google Blog](http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2009/11/releasing-chromium-os-open-source.html). This release of Chromium OS includes:

* [Source code](http://www.chromium.org/chromium-os/building-chromium-os/getting-the-chromium-os-source-code)
* [Design docs](http://www.chromium.org/chromium-os/chromiumos-design-docs)
* [User interface experiments](http://www.chromium.org/chromium-os/user-experience)
* [How to build and contribute](http://www.chromium.org/developers/contributing-code)
* [Short overview video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0QRO3gKj3qw)

We are doing this early, almost a year before Google Chrome OS will be ready for users, because we are eager to engage with open source developers. There are many of you who share our passion for creating a new model of computing. Chromium OS makes it possible for any interested developer to contribute code, ideas and designs to help shape the future of personal computing.

Speed, simplicity and security are fundamental to Chrome OS. We wanted to talk about these areas in a bit more detail.

**Speed**

**Simplicity**

**Security**

**Open Source**

We expect to publish additional design docs and documentation in the upcoming few months. You can track what we're doing on this blog and we hope you will join us in this effort.
