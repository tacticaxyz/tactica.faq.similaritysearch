# More secure and convenient Autofill coming to Chrome
- **Published**: 2020-07-30T10:00:00.002-07:00
Chrome can help you fill in forms securely - everywhere on the web. Whether it is your username and password to sign in to your email account, or your credit card number when you’re about to purchase your new favorite pair of sneakers. Today we’re announcing new tools to make your Autofill experience even more convenient and secure.   
  

### Confirming credit cards with biometrics

If you choose to save credit cards to your Google Account, your payment information is only transferred to Chrome when it is needed for a transaction. This is why Chrome asks you to confirm your credit card by entering its CVC before the full credit card number is autofilled into a form.  
  
Going forward, Chrome will allow you to enroll your device to retrieve card numbers via biometric authentication, such as your fingerprint. You still need to provide your CVC the first time you use your credit card, but for future transactions, you will be able to confirm your credit card using biometric authentication ᠆ instead of requiring you to pull out your wallet and type in its CVC. Biometric authentication is optional. You can choose to confirm your card with its CVC and you can also turn this feature on and off in Chrome Settings at any time.   
  
Chrome uses the W3C standard WebAuthn to securely enroll you for biometric authentication. Biometric information never leaves your device. The feature is already available on Windows and Mac and is coming to Chrome on Android in the coming weeks.

### Touch-to-fill for passwords

  
Chrome’s password manager can help you save passwords for the sites you visit so that you don’t need to memorize them. It also helps you fill your passwords the next time you sign in. A big advantage of using a password manager is that it helps prevent phishing attacks, because it cannot be tricked into filling your password into look-alike websites.

Whenever you sign in, Chrome’s new touch-to-fill feature presents your saved accounts for the current website in a convenient and recognizable dialog. It allows for one-handed sign-in without requiring you to scroll to the respective form fields to choose an account.

Signing in is now easier with touch-to-fill controls.

The feature is coming to Chrome on Android in the coming weeks, but this is only the start. We’ll continue to focus on creating intuitive features that keep you safe while you sign-in and pay on the web, and look forward to sharing more in the future.
