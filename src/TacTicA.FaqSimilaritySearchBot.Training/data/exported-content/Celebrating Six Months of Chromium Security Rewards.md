# Celebrating Six Months of Chromium Security Rewards
- **Published**: 2010-07-20T14:07:00.000-07:00
It has been approximately six months since we launched the [Chromium Security Reward program](http://blog.chromium.org/2010/01/encouraging-more-chromium-security.html). Although still early days, the program has been a clear success. We have been notified of numerous bugs, and some of the participants have made it clear that it was the reward program that motivated them to get involved with Chromium security.

We maintain a list of issued rewards on the [Chromium security page](http://dev.chromium.org/Home/chromium-security). As the list indicates, a range of researchers have sent us some great bugs and the rewards are flowing! This list should also help answer questions about which sort of bugs might qualify for rewards.

Today, we are modifying the program in two ways:

1. The maximum reward for a single bug has been increased to **$3,133.7**. We will most likely use this amout for [SecSeverity-Critical](http://dev.chromium.org/developers/severity-guidelines) bugs in Chromium. The increased reward reflects the fact that [the sandbox](http://seclab.stanford.edu/websec/chromium/chromium-security-architecture.pdf) makes it harder to find bugs of this severity.
2. Whilst the base reward for less serious bugs remains at $500, the panel will consider rewarding more for high-quality bug reports. Factors indicating a high-quality bug report might include a careful test case reduction, an accurate analysis of root cause, or productive discussion towards resolution.

Thanks to everyone who contributes to Chromium security, and hereâ€™s looking forward to our first elite entrant!

**UPDATE**: We've had a few questions about whether we pay rewards in cases where the bug comes to us via a vulnerability broker. Bugs reported in this way are not likely to generate Chromium rewards. We encourage researchers to file bugs directly with us, as doing so helps us get started sooner on fixes and removes questions about who else may have access to the bug details. We'd also remind researchers that we don't necessarily require a working exploit in order to issue a reward. For example, evidence of memory corruption would typically be sufficient.
