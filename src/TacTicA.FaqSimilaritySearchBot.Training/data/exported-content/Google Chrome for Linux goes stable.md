# Google Chrome for Linux goes stable
- **Published**: 2010-05-25T08:58:00.000-07:00
Since the [initial beta release](http://blog.chromium.org/2009/12/google-chrome-for-linux-goes-beta.html) of Google Chrome for Linux [last December](http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2009/12/google-chrome-for-holidays-mac-linux.html), we've been hard at work adding the polish necessary to upgrade the browser to our stable channel.   
  
With continued improvements in plugin support, extensions functionality, and desktop integration, as well as new features such as desktop notifications and bookmark sync, we believe this release of [Google Chrome for Linux](http://www.google.com/chrome?platform=linux) to be a solid, high-performance, fully-featured, all-purpose browser. From the [early porting days](http://www.google.com/chrome/intl/en/w00t.html) of layout test fixing, deep and hairy posix and raw X11 code, to designing a truly native UI and building a host of new and polished features, weâ€™re thrilled to work with the larger community to deliver a fast, stable, secure, and sophisticated browser.   
  
Going forward, we are committed to continuing to deliver all the security, performance, and features (old and new) of Google Chrome for Windows, while integrating as seamlessly as possible with the Linux desktop ecosystem on a variety of popular Linux distributions.
