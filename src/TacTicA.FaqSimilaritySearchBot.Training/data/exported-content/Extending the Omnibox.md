One of the most powerful aspects of Google Chrome is the omnibox, also known as the address bar. You can type URLs and searches into one unified place and it all just works. With the new [omnibox API](http://code.google.com/chrome/extensions/omnibox.html), extension developers can make the omnibox even more powerful.

Keep an eye out for cool new extensions as developers get their hands on this API!
