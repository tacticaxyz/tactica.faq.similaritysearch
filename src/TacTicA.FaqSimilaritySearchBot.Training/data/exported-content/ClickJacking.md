# ClickJacking
- **Published**: 2009-01-29T12:44:00.000-08:00
Although the term "ClickJacking" is new, the underlying issue has been known for years. ClickJacking attacks affect all Web browsers because the attacks rely on standard browser features to trick the user into clicking on a dangerous spot on another Web page. A few months ago, Jeremiah Grossman and Robert Hansen sparked renewed interest in ClickJacking by demonstrating a [clever application of the technique](http://jeremiahgrossman.blogspot.com/2008/10/clickjacking-web-pages-can-see-and-hear.html) against Flash Player. Unfortunately, there is no "silver bullet" solution to all ClickJacking attacks. To find the best long-term solution, we're collaborating with other browser vendors and the standards community. If you're interested in ClickJacking solutions, I'd recommend reading Mark Pilgrim's summary of [recent ClickJacking discussion in the HTML 5 working group](http://blog.whatwg.org/this-week-in-html-5-episode-7) and [joining in the discussion](http://www.w3.org/html/wg/).
