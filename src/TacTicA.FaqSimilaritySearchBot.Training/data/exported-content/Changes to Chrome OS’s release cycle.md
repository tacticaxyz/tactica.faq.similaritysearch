# Changes to Chrome OS’s release cycle
- **Published**: 2021-06-11T07:58:00.000-07:00
We [previously announced](https://blog.chromium.org/2021/03/speeding-up-release-cycle.html) that Chrome will soon release a new milestone every 4 weeks, starting with Chrome 94 in Q3 of 2021. We’re excited to also share our plans today for adjusting the Chrome OS release schedule.   
  
To deliver new features more rapidly to consumers while also continuing to prioritize the key pillars of Chrome OS – security, stability, speed and simplicity – Chrome OS will move to a 4-week stable channel starting with M96 in Q4. For enterprise and education users, Chrome OS will also introduce a new channel with a 6-month update cadence by M96. More details to be announced soon.  
  
To bridge the gap between M94 when Chrome moves to a four week release and M96, Chrome OS will skip M95 (see the updated Chrome [schedule page](https://chromiumdash.appspot.com/schedule) for milestone-specific details).   
  
As we head into our next decade, these changes enable us to evolve Chrome OS to keep helping people get things done and to provide more helpful and secure experiences.
