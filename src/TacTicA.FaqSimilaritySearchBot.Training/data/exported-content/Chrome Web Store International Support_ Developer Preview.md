# Chrome Web Store International Support: Developer Preview
- **Published**: 2011-02-17T15:30:00.000-08:00
When we [recently announced](http://chrome.blogspot.com/2011/02/dash-of-speed-3d-and-apps.html) the availability of the Chrome Web Store to Chrome users in the US, we mentioned that we were hard at work making the store available globally. Today we’re excited to announce a preview release of the upload flow for several international markets as a step towards that goal.

Starting today, when you upload an app via the [developer dashboard](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/developer/dashboard), you’ll have the option of selecting from the following sixteen countries to list your app: Argentina, Australia, Brazil, Canada, France, Germany, India, Italy, Japan, Mexico, Netherlands, Poland, Portugal, Spain, United Kingdom and the United States. If you are using [Chrome Web Store Payments](http://code.google.com/chrome/webstore/docs/index.html#charging) to charge for your app, you will also be able to set the app price for each country although if you’re not based in the United States you will not be able to complete your merchant account sign up just yet (this will be enabled soon).

Note that these apps will not yet be published to countries outside the United States. This will happen when the Chrome Web Store opens to consumers in these countries later this year. We are releasing this developer preview ahead of the consumer release so you have enough time to prepare your apps for international users.

We hope you can use this release to get familiar with the app upload process and take time to [localize your app listing](http://code.google.com/chrome/extensions/i18n.html) to make it accessible to more people. If you have additional questions, please take a look at [our FAQ](http://code.google.com/chrome/webstore/faq.html) or join our [developer discussion group](https://groups.google.com/a/chromium.org/group/chromium-apps/topics).
