# Calling all Students!  Work on Chromium during Google Summer of Code
- **Published**: 2010-04-06T18:00:00.000-07:00
This Friday, April 9th at 19:00 UTC is the deadline for students to apply to this year's [Google Summer of Code](http://code.google.com/soc/).  
  
The Chromium project has been accepted as a mentoring organization for this awesome program. This means that you have the opportunity to work on exciting new features for Chromium over the summer, experience real-world browser development with a Chromium team mentor, and, of course, receive a stipend.  
  
To participate, first pick an idea off our [handy ideas list](http://code.google.com/p/chromium/wiki/GoogleSummerOfCode2010) or come up with your own. Next, discuss it with a prospective mentor on our [mailing list](http://groups.google.com/a/chromium.org/group/chromium-dev/topics) or [irc channel](http://dev.chromium.org/contact). Finally, when youâ€™re confident you have a solid idea, write up a proposal on how you'd implement it in the allotted time frame (3 months) and submit it at the official [gsoc website](http://code.google.com/soc/). In evaluating proposals, we'll be looking for familiarity with the codebase and lots of intelligent detail. The more detail you can provide, the better!  
  
Once again, [proposals are due](http://socghop.appspot.com/document/show/gsoc_program/google/gsoc2010/timeline) Friday. We're looking forward to seeing great project proposals and expanding our community!
