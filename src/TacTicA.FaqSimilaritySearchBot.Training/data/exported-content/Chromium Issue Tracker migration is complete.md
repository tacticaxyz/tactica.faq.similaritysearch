# Chromium Issue Tracker migration is complete
- **Published**: 2024-02-05T08:42:00.000-08:00
We are thrilled to share that Chromium issue tracking has migrated! [Access the Issue Tracker](https://issues.chromium.org/issues)[,](http://issues.chromium.org) and [supporting documentation](https://www.chromium.org/for-testers/faq/). 

Why was this done
=================

  
  
Issue tracking moved from Monorail to the Chromium Issue Tracker (powered by the [Google Issue Tracker](https://developers.google.com/issue-tracker)) to provide a feature-rich and well-supported issue tracker for Chromium’s ecosystem. Chromium joins other open source projects (Git, Gerrit) on this tooling.   
  

What happens moving forward 

Existing Monorail issue links will redirect to the migrated issues in the new issue tracker. We will prioritize feedback to continue to improve the issue tracker experience.
