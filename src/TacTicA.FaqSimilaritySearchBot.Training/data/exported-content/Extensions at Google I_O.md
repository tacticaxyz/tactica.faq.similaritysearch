# Extensions at Google I/O
- **Published**: 2009-05-27T12:00:00.000-07:00
Today I gave a presentation at [Google I/O](http://code.google.com/events/io/) explaining some of the cool ideas that lie at the heart of our upcoming [extension system](http://dev.chromium.org/developers/design-documents/extensions). For those who didn't get a chance to attend the conference, you can check out the slides, below:

The actions menu, visible in full-screen mode, will let you show speaker notes. We'll also post a video of the talk as soon as it's available.

As some of you know, it's already possible to write [extensions](http://dev.chromium.org/developers/design-documents/extensions/samples) using the latest developer build of Google Chrome. You can find out more about the system, and learn how to write your first extension, by reading our [HOWTO](http://dev.chromium.org/developers/design-documents/extensions/howto) document. We've really focused on making extensions as easy as possible to write, so you'll be up and running in no time.

We're still pretty early in the development of the extensions system, and we're constantly adding new features and tweaking the APIs based on your feedback. So if you try it out, we'd love to hear from you at [chromium-discuss@chromium.org](mailto:chromium-discuss@chromium.org).

Happy coding!

**Update:** Video of this talk is now [available](http://code.google.com/events/io/sessions/DevelopingExtensionsGoogleChrome.html), as are videos of a number of other [Google Chrome-related talks](http://code.google.com/events/io/sessions.html#client).
