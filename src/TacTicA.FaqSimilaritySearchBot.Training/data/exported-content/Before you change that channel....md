# Before you change that channel...
- **Published**: 2010-01-07T07:01:00.000-08:00
If you've been waiting for extensions to be available for the Mac version of Google Chrome, you finally have a chance to try them out. [Extensions](https://chrome.google.com/extensions/) are now available on the new [developer channel of Google Chrome for Mac](http://dev.chromium.org/getting-involved/dev-channel). Just like the Windows version, Google Chrome for the Mac again has a [developer channel](http://blog.chromium.org/2009/01/google-chrome-release-channels.html). If you're willing to put up with some rough edges, you can download the developer channel version. You'll be regularly updated to the latest (but not always the greatest) version of Google Chrome for the Mac. If not, sit tight--we're working on bringing extensions to the beta channel.   
  
Note that all of the original developer channel users prior to the Google Chrome for Mac [beta](http://google.com/chrome?platform=mac) release were migrated to the beta channel as a part of the first [beta rollout](http://googlemac.blogspot.com/2009/12/google-chrome-for-mac-goes-beta.html). If you were on the Mac developer channel at some point, you'll have to reinstall the developer channel version just this once.
