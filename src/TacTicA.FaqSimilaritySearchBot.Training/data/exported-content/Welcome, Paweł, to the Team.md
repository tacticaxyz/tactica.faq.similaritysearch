# Welcome, Paweł, to the Team
- **Published**: 2008-12-12T10:08:00.000-08:00
Since we open-sourced Chromium, we've had patches contributed from all over the world. Once we published [guidelines](http://dev.chromium.org/getting-involved/become-a-committer) on how contributors can become committers, Paweł Hajdan Jr. was the obvious first choice for nomination.

Paweł is a computer science student at the University of Warsaw, and in his free time he's managed to write a ton of high-quality code towards making Chromium work on non-Windows platforms. Those of us who have worked on committing his near-daily patches are relieved to see that he'll now be able to commit them himself!
