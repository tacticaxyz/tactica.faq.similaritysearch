# Google Chrome Developer Update: 3000 Extensions, Events on 4 Continents and More
- **Published**: 2010-03-04T10:37:00.000-08:00
This is the first issue of Google Chrome Update for Web Developers. In these regular updates, we'll inform you about new features enabled in Google Chrome and announce updates of Google Chrome related developer events. We will also be sharing samples and highlighting cool extensions and HTML5 apps written by the developer community.

**What's New in Google Chrome?**

The Google Chrome Beta channel for Mac and Linux has been updated to [5.0.307.7](http://googlechromereleases.blogspot.com/2010/02/beta-update-mac-and-linux.html) and the extensions gallery now offers more than [3000](https://chrome.google.com/extensions/) extensions for users to choose from.

For Google Chrome extensions, we've just released a couple of new [experimental APIs](http://blog.chromium.org/2010/03/experimental-extension-apis.html), including a history API. Since these are experimental APIs, the extensions gallery won't allow you to upload extensions that use them. However, we'd like to encourage you to read the [documentation](http://code.google.com/chrome/extensions/trunk/experimental.history.html), give it a try, and send us your [feedback](http://groups.google.com/a/chromium.org/group/chromium-extensions/topics).

Last but not least, the new Google Chrome stable release has many new [HTML and JavaScript APIs](http://blog.chromium.org/2010/01/more-resources-for-developers.html) including [WebSockets](http://dev.w3.org/html5/websockets/), [Notifications](http://dev.chromium.org/developers/design-documents/desktop-notifications/api-specification), and [Web SQL Database](http://dev.w3.org/html5/webdatabase/). We are interested to hear how you've been using these APIs. Please [share](https://groups.google.com/a/chromium.org/group/chromium-html5/topics) with us the cool applications you are building.

**Samples and Tutorials**

We've been working on creating samples to help you implement certain functionality in your extensions. You may be interested in viewing the source code for extensions that:

* [Merge](http://src.chromium.org/viewvc/chrome/trunk/src/chrome/common/extensions/docs/examples/api/windows/merge_windows/) all of the open tabs into a single window.
* Use [OAuth](http://src.chromium.org/viewvc/chrome/trunk/src/chrome/common/extensions/docs/examples/extensions/oauth_contacts/) to connect to web services.
* Make cross-domain [XMLHttpRequests](http://src.chromium.org/viewvc/chrome/trunk/src/chrome/common/extensions/docs/examples/howto/contentscript_xhr/) from a content script.
* Display page actions based on the [current URL](http://src.chromium.org/viewvc/chrome/trunk/src/chrome/common/extensions/docs/examples/api/pageAction/pageaction_by_url/) or the current page's [content](http://src.chromium.org/viewvc/chrome/trunk/src/chrome/common/extensions/docs/examples/api/pageAction/pageaction_by_content/).
