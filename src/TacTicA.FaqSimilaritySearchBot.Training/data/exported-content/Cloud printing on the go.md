# Cloud printing on the go
- **Published**: 2011-01-24T09:39:00.000-08:00
Last month, we [opened Google Cloud Print](http://blog.chromium.org/2010/06/update-on-google-cloud-print.html) to users in the Chrome notebook pilot program. [Google Cloud Print](http://blog.chromium.org/2010/04/new-approach-to-printing.html) allows printing from any app on any device, OS or browser without the need to install drivers. Today, we are very pleased to announce the beta launch of Google Cloud Print for mobile documents and Gmail for mobile, which we will be rolling out to users throughout the next few days. To read more about how to use Google Cloud Print for these mobile use cases, read more in the [Google Mobile blog](http://googlemobile.blogspot.com/2011/01/cloud-printing-on-go.html).
