# Chromium and Google Summer of Code
- **Published**: 2009-03-25T17:01:00.000-07:00
Time is quickly running out for the students to apply for this year's [Google Summer of Code](http://code.google.com/soc/).

The Chromium project has been accepted as a mentoring organization for this awesome program. This means that over the summer, you have the opportunity to work on new and exciting features for Chromium (and supporting projects) and experience browser development first-hand with a mentor from the project and real deadlines.

Full guidelines and details on how to apply can be found on the official [gsoc website](http://code.google.com/soc/). To participate, pick an idea off our [handy list](http://docs.google.com/Edit?id=dhk32tn7_0g7kcr2cg) or suggest one of your own (it's best to discuss it with a mentor first), then write up a proposal on how you'd go about accomplishing the task in the allotted time frame (3 months).

You can find a list of suggested topics [here](http://docs.google.com/Edit?id=dhk32tn7_0g7kcr2cg). These are only recommendations though, feel free to stop by our [mailing list](http://groups.google.com/group/chromium-dev) or [irc channel](http://dev.chromium.org/contact) and suggest something new. If you do decide to write your own proposal, we're looking for familiarity with the codebase, and lots of intelligent detail. The more details you can provide, the better!

[Student registration](http://socghop.appspot.com/) runs from the 23rd of March until the 3rd of April. We're looking forward to seeing the project submissions and expanding our community involvement.
