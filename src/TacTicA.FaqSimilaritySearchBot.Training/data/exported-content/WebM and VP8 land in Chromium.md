# WebM and VP8 land in Chromium
- **Published**: 2010-05-19T10:11:00.000-07:00
A developer preview of [WebM](http://www.webmproject.org/), a high-quality, open, freely implementable, and web-optimized video format was [announced](http://webmproject.blogspot.com/2010/05/introducing-webm-open-web-media-project.html) today. Initial support for WebM, including its video codec VP8 will be checked into Chromium later tonight. You can try it by building Chromium yourself or watch for it in the dev channel build in the coming weeks.
