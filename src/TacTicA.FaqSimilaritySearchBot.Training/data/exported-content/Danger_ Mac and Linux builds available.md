# Danger: Mac and Linux builds available
- **Published**: 2009-06-04T20:00:00.000-07:00
In order to get more feedback from developers, we have early [developer channel](http://blog.chromium.org/2009/01/google-chrome-release-channels.html) versions of Google Chrome for [Mac OS X](http://www.google.com/chrome/intl/en/eula_dev.html?dl=mac) and [Linux](http://dev.chromium.org/getting-involved/dev-channel), but whatever you do, please DON'T DOWNLOAD THEM! Unless of course you are a developer or take great pleasure in incomplete, unpredictable, and potentially crashing software.  
  
How incomplete? So incomplete that, [among other things](http://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/list?can=2&q=OS:Linux,Mac)Â , you won't yet be able to view YouTube videos, change your privacy settings, set your default search provider, or even print.  
  
Meanwhile, we'll get back to trying to get Google Chrome on these platforms stable enough for a beta release as soon as possible!
