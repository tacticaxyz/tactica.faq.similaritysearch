# An Update on Google Chrome Extensions Hackathons
- **Published**: 2010-05-27T15:27:00.000-07:00
As part of the Developer Relations team at Google, we get the chance to run lots of different types of events. Some of the most rewarding are hackathons that involve writing Google Chrome Extensions. We always love watching developers create useful features for Google Chrome in just a few hours.  
  
Recently, [our friends at Twilio](http://www.twilio.com/) ran their own online Google Chrome Extensions hackathon. The winners, Brad Berkin and Timothee Boucher, used the Twilio API to integrate the Twilio and extensions platforms, adding cool new functionality to Google Chrome.  
  
[Brad’s Chro-wilio extension](https://chrome.google.com/extensions/detail/kkdbagkelggilgfcmhmgagengjfbancf) tells you how many notifications, calls, and messages you’ve received in your Twilio account in the last day, week, or month. [Timothee’s Notwilfications extension](http://timotheeboucher.com/twilio/chrome/Notwilfications.crx) lets you know when a call is routed to your account. You can check who’s calling and either ignore the call or send it to voicemail without ever having to pick up your phone. When voicemail messages are recorded, a toolbar badge will show you the number of messages you have and let you play them right in the browser.  
  
We’d like to thank all the developers who participated in this contest, as well as the Twilio team for organizing it. You can find more info about the contest on [Twilio’s blog](http://blog.twilio.com/2010/05/announcing-the-winners-of-the-twilio-google-chrome-extensions-contest.html).  
  
For those of you who missed this opportunity and are based in New York, we’re planning an extensions hackathon in our local office on June 10th. If you’re interested in attending, all you need to do is fill out [this form](https://spreadsheets4.google.com/a/google.com/viewform?hl=en&formkey=dGxsZXFxd1FHZHNPR2ozeWxZeWNxT2c6MQ#gid=0) before June 6th. Space is limited, but we’ll try to accommodate everyone who signs up. We hope to see you there!
