# Thanks for all Your Help
- **Published**: 2008-12-11T09:07:00.000-08:00
Today we [announced](http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2008/12/google-chrome-beta.html) that with Google Chrome's fifteenth release, we are taking off the "beta" label. We set goals around improving the stability and performance of the browser, and many of you have helped us meet these goals. We are grateful to the many people around the world who have contributed patches to Chromium (we had our first come from Korea after only five hours), the dedicated volunteers who have filed and triaged bugs in our [issue tracker](http://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/list), the loyal users who braved the sometimes rocky [dev channel](http://dev.chromium.org/getting-involved/dev-channel) releases, and everyone who took the simple step of [opting-in](http://www.google.com/support/chrome/bin/answer.py?answer=96817) to sending usage statistics and crash reports.

Google Chrome wouldn't be where it is today without your help. Of course, there's still a ton more to do, so keep the feedback, patches, bug reports, and moral support coming!
