Due to adjusted work schedules at this time, we are pausing upcoming Chrome and Chrome OS releases. Our primary objectives are to ensure Chrome continues to be stable, secure, and work reliably for anyone who depends on them. Weâ€™ll continue to prioritize any updates related to security, which will be included in Chrome 80.
