# LoadLine Benchmark

This folder contains configs for the LoadLine benchmark. The goal of the
benchmark is to facilitate web performance optimization based on a realistic
workload. The benchmark has two workload variants:

*   General-purpose workload representative of the web usage on mobile phones
    ("phone");

*   Android Tablet web performance workload ("tablet").

Google employees: see [go/loadline-internal](http://go/loadline-internal) for
Google-specific info.

See the
[LoadLine component](https://g-issues.chromium.org/issues?q=status:open%20componentid:1670299)
for the list of open bugs.

## tl;dr: Running the Benchmark

Run "phone" workload:

```
./cb.py loadline-phone --browser <browser> --cool-down-threshold moderate
```

Run "tablet" workload:

```
./cb.py loadline-tablet --browser <browser> --cool-down-threshold moderate
```

The browser can be `android:chrome-canary`, `android:chrome-stable` etc. See
crossbench docs for the full list of options.

Cool down threshold is recommended because by default the benchmark runs 100
repetitions, which creates a significant load on the device and can lead to
overheating. This option will insert cooldown periods to ensure that the device
stays below the given thermal level. Possible values include `light`,
`moderate`, and `severe`.

Results will be located in `results/latest/`. Notable files in this directory:

*   `loadline_probe.csv`: Final score for the run
*   `trace_processor/loadline_benchmark_score.csv`: Breakdown of scores per
    page and repetition

## Benchmark Details

### Background

Web is one of the most important use cases on mobile devices. Page loading speed
represents a crucial part of user experience, and is not well covered by
existing benchmarks (Speedometer, Jetstream, MotionMark). Experiments show that
raw CPU performance does not always result in faster web loading speeds, since
it's a complex highly parallelized process that stresses a lot of browser and OS
components and their interactions. Hence the need for a dedicated web loading
benchmark that will enable us to compare devices, track improvements across OS
and browser releases.

### Workload

We aimed for two configurations:

*   **Representative mobile Web on Android usage (~5 pages)**

    Aimed at covering loading scenarios representative of real web workloads and
    user environments on Android mobile phones.

*   **Android Tablet web performance (~5 pages)**

    A set of larger desktop-class workloads intended for tablet/large screen
    devices running Android.

The biggest challenges we faced in achieving this goal were:

*   **Representativeness**: How do we determine a representative set of web
    sites given the humongous corpus of websites whose overall distribution is
    not thoroughly understood.
*   **Metrics** Existing page load metrics generalize well for O(millions) of
    page loads across a variety of sites, but are poor fit to judge performance
    of a specific site
*   **Noise**: The web evolves. To ensure the benchmark workloads stay
    consistent over time, we chose to use recorded & replayed workloads.
    However, page load is very complex and indeterministic so naive replays are
    often not consistent.

### Site Selection

We did a thorough analysis to ensure we select relevant and representative
sites. Our aspiration was to understand the distribution of the most important
CUJs and performance characteristics on the web and use this knowledge to elect
a small number of representative CUJs, such that their performance
characteristics maximize coverage of the distribution.

Practically, we evaluated ~50 prominent sites across a number of different
characteristics (dimensions) via trace-based analysis, cross-checking via field
data. We clustered similar pages and selected representatives for important
clusters. In the end, this was a manual selection aided by algorithmic
clustering/correlation analysis.

We looked at over 20 dimensions for suitability and relevance to our site
selection, and low correlation between dimensions. Of these, we chose 6 primary
metrics that we optimized coverage on: Website type, workload size (CPU time),
DOM/Layout complexity (#nodes), JavaScript heap size, time spent in V8, time
spent in V8 callbacks into Blink. Secondarily, we included utilization of web
features and relevant mojo interfaces, e.g. Video, cookies, main/subframe
communication, input events, frame production, network requests, etc.

In the end we selected 5 sites for each configuration which we plan to extend in
the future.

### Metrics

Measuring page load accurately in generic ways is difficult (e.g. some pages
require significant work after LCP to become "interactive") and inaccurate
metrics risk incorrect power/perf trade-off choices. Once we had a selection of
sites, we looked at each one of them and devised site-specific metrics that
better reflect when a page is ready to be interacted with.

## Reproducibility / Noise

Page load is a very complex process and is inherently noisy. There is a lot of
concurrent work happening in the browser and slight timing differences can have
big impact in the actual workload being executed and thus in the perceived load
speed.

We took various measures to try to reduce this variability, but there is still
room to improve and we plan to do this in the next versions of this benchmark.

### Score

We are still actively developing this benchmark and we will try our best to keep
the score as stable across changes as possible. We will update the benchmark's
minor version if we introduce changes that have a chance of affecting the score.
This version is reported in the benchmark output and should be quoted when
sharing scores.

### Cross-device Comparisons

Workload on two different devices will differ due to variance in application
tasks, such as the number of frames rendered during load, timers being executed
more frequently during load, etc.

It is important to stress that page load is a complex workload. As a result, if
we were to compare scores between two devices A and B, device A having 2x the
CPU speed compared to device B, then A's score will be less than 2x of B's
score. This is not an error or an artifact of the measurement, this is a result
of the adaptable nature of web loading (and / or potential effort of a browser
trying to get the best user experience from the resources available). The
benchmark score reflects the actual user-observable loading speed.

### Web Page Replay

To maintain reproducibility, the benchmark uses the
[web page replay](https://chromium.googlesource.com/catapult/+/HEAD/web_page_replay_go/README.md)
mechanism. Archives of the web pages are stored in the
`chrome-partner-telemetry` cloud bucket, so you'll need access to that bucket to
run the benchmark on recorded pages.

### Repetitions {#repetitions}

By default, the benchmark runs **100** repetitions, as we have found that this
brings the noise to an acceptable level. For quicker experiments, it's possible
to run just 10 repetitions (at the expense of higher variance / lower
confidence) using the following command:

```
./cb.py loadline-phone-fast --browser <browser>
```

You can also run an arbitrary number of repetitions by providing the
`--repetitions` flag.

### Thermal Throttling

Given the high number of repetitions in the standard configuration, thermal
throttling can be an issue, especially in more thermally constricted devices. A
one size fits all solution to this problem is quite hard; even detecting this is
very device specific. The `--cool-down-threshold` flag can be used to try to
detect thermal throttling based on the device's overall thermal status. If you
still see thermal issues while using this flag, try adding fixed delays between
repetitions via `--cool-down-time` instead.

## Debugging / Alternative running options

In its standard configuration, the benchmark will run 100 iterations. In
addition, the WPR server will run on device, rather than on the host, to reduce
the noise caused by the latency introduced by the host to device connection.

Both these settings can be overridden if needed / desirable.
([Repetitions](#repetitions), [WPR on host](#host_wpr))

### Record a new WPR archive

Uncomment the `wpr: {},` line in the probe config and run the benchmark on live
sites using
```
./cb.py loadline-phone --browser <browser> --network live
```

The archive will be located in
`results/latest/archive.wprgo`.

*WARNING:* Running the benchmark on the new archive will produce different
scores, which will not be comparable with the default benchmark configuration.
Some metrics might break completely. Only use this option if you are ready to
debug and modify metrics as well.

### Running WPR on the host {#host_wpr}

If you care about running as little overhead as possible on the device, e.g. for
power measurements, you might consider running the WPR server on the host
machine instead of the device under test. You can do this by

Adding `run_on_device: false,` to the corresponding network config file
`config/benchmark/loadline/network_config_phone.hjson` or
`config/benchmark/loadline/network_config_tablet.hjson`.

Note golang must be available on the host machine. Check
[go.mod](https://chromium.googlesource.com/catapult/+/HEAD/web_page_replay_go/go.mod)
for the minimum version.

### Run the benchmark with full set of experimental metrics

Sometimes to investigate a source of a regression, or get deeper insights,
it may be useful to collect more detailed traces and compute additional metrics.
This can be done with the following command:

```
./cb.py loadline-phone-debug --browser <browser>
```

Note that collecting detailed traces incurs significant overhead, so the
benchmark scores will likely be lower than in the default configuration.

## Common issues

### Problems finding wpr.go

If you see a `Could not find wpr.go binary` error:

*   If you have chromium checked out locally: set `CHROMIUM_SRC` environment
    variable to the path of your chromium/src folder.
*   If not (or if you're still getting this error): see the next section.

### Running the benchmark without full chromium checkout

Follow the
[crossbench development instructions](https://chromium.googlesource.com/crossbench/#development)
to check out code and run crossbench standalone. Make sure to `fetch` using
depot\_tools instead of cloning the git repository, this ensures that third
party dependencies are set up correctly.

### Problems accessing the cloud bucket

In some cases, you might need to download the web page archive manually. In this
case, save the archive file corresponding to the version you are running
(`gs://chrome-partner-telemetry/loading_benchmark/archive_*.wprgo`) locally and
run the benchmark as follows:

```
./cb.py loadline-phone --browser <browser> --network <path to archive.wprgo>
```
