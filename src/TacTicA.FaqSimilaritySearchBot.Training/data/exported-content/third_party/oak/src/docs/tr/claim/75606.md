# Landing page for claim for Oak binaries with secure logging

Claim UUID: 75606\
Link to self:
https://github.com/project-oak/oak/blob/main/docs/tr/claim/75606.md

An endorsement that doesn't have this claim means the underlying binary doesn't
log securely. This is intended to discriminate between e.g.
`oak_functions_container` (would have the claim) or
`oak_functions_insecure_container` (would not have the claim).
