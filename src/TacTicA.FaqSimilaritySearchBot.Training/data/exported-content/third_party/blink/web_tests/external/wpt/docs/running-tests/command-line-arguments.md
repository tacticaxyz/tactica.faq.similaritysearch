# Command-Line Arguments

The `wpt` command-line application offers a number of features for interacting
with WPT. The functionality is organized into "sub-commands", and each accepts
a different set of command-line arguments.

This page documents all of the available sub-commands and associated arguments.

```eval_rst
.. argparse::
   :module: tools.wpt.wpt
   :func: create_complete_parser
   :prog: wpt
```
