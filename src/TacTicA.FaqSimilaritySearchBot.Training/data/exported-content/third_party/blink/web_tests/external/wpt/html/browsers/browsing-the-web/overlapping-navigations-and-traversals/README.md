# Overlapping navigation and traversal tests

These tests follow the behavior outlined in the
[session history rewrite](https://github.com/whatwg/html/pull/6315).

<https://github.com/whatwg/html/issues/6927> discusses these results.

We are not yet 100% sure on this behavior, especially for overlapping
traversal cases where the spec is complex and some of the tests don't
seem to match any browser. Please feel free to discuss on the spec
issue.
