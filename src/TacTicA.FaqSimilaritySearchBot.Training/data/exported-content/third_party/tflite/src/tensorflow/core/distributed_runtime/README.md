# Distributed TensorFlow

This directory contains the initial open-source implementation of the
distributed TensorFlow runtime, using [gRPC](http://grpc.io) for inter-process
communication.

To learn how to use the distributed runtime to create a TensorFlow cluster, see
the
[Distributed TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/guide/distributed_training)
How-To.
