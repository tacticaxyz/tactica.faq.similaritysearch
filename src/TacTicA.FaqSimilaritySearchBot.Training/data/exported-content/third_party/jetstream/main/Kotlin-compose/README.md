# Kotlin/Wasm Compose Multiplatform Benchmark

Citing https://github.com/JetBrains/compose-multiplatform:

> [Compose Multiplatform](https://jb.gg/cmp) is a declarative framework for sharing UIs across multiple platforms with Kotlin.
[...]
Compose for Web is based on [Kotlin/Wasm](https://kotl.in/wasm), the newest target for Kotlin Multiplatform projects.
It allows Kotlin developers to run their code in the browser with all the benefits that WebAssembly has to offer, such as good and predictable performance for your applications.

## Build Instructions

See or run `build.sh`.
See `build.log` for the last build time, used sources, and toolchain versions.

## Running in JS shells
