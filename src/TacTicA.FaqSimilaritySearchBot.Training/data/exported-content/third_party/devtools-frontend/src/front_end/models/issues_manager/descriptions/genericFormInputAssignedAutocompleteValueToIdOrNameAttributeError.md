# An element doesn't have an autocomplete attribute

A form field has an `id` or `name` attribute that the browser's autofill recognizes. However, it doesn't have an `autocomplete` attribute assigned. This might prevent the browser from correctly autofilling the form.

To fix this issue, provide an `autocomplete` attribute.
