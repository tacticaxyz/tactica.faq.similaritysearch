# Specify a Cross-Origin Embedder Policy to prevent this frame from being blocked

Because your site has the Cross-Origin Embedder Policy (COEP) enabled, each
embedded iframe must also specify this policy. This behavior protects private
data from being exposed to untrusted third party sites.

To solve this, add one of following to the embedded frameâ€™s HTML response
header:
* `Cross-Origin-Embedder-Policy: require-corp`
* `Cross-Origin-Embedder-Policy: credentialless` (Chrome > 96)
