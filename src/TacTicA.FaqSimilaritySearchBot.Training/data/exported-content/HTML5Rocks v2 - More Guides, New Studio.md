# HTML5Rocks v2 - More Guides, New Studio
- **Published**: 2010-08-13T14:03:00.000-07:00
We think HTML5 will make your work more engaging and create a faster, more responsive experience for your users, so we're happy to add today a slew of new content to [html5rocks.com](http://html5rocks.com/).

If you want to not only get up to speed, but understand the browser differences and techniques for a robust implementation, please take a look through the new guides for implementing [HTML5 video](http://www.html5rocks.com/tutorials/video/basics/), [understanding "offline,"](http://www.html5rocks.com/tutorials/offline/whats-offline/) [auditing your webapp](http://www.html5rocks.com/tutorials/developertools/auditpanel/) with the Chrome developer tools, and using [web workers](http://www.html5rocks.com/tutorials/workers/basics/) and [@font-face](http://www.html5rocks.com/tutorials/webfonts/quick/). You can now comment about your experiences with these features and stay up to date on new content via our new [RSS feed](http://www.html5rocks.com/tutorials/index.xml).

We're also sharing the new [HTML5 Studio](http://studio.html5rocks.com/), a collection of samples of these features in use, with code you can learn from and hack on.
