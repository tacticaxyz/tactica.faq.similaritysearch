# Update to Developers: Chromium Issue Tracker migration
- **Published**: 2023-10-16T08:30:00.000-07:00
Update: Migration is on track for early February 2024 instead of January 2024.

Chromium is moving to a different issue tracker to provide a well-supported user experience for the long term. The Google team is targeting January 2024 for migration—this post explains the details.

  

What’s happening
================

We will migrate all Chromium issues, including issue history and stars, from Monorail to a different tool: Chromium Issue Tracker, powered by the [Google Issue Tracker](https://developers.google.com/issue-tracker). This tooling change will provide a feature-rich and well-supported issue tracker for Chromium’s ecosystem. Chromium will join other open source projects (Git, Gerrit) on this tooling. Existing transparency levels to bugs will be maintained. 

  

Timing

We are targeting January 2024 for Chromium’s migration, and will share milestones and timing updates throughout the coming months.

  

Migration Readiness

In due course, we will share additional resources, including a walkthrough of the new issue tracker, highlighting key features.

  

Post-Migration 

While there will be differences, we are working to make the migration straightforward. Once the migration completes, existing Monorail issue links will redirect to the migrated issues in the new issue tracker.
