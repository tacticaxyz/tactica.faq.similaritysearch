# The Chrome Web Store
- **Published**: 2010-05-19T09:55:00.000-07:00
We believe it should be easier for users to discover web apps and for developers to reach a large audience. Thatâ€™s why today at [Google I/O](http://code.google.com/events/io/2010/), we announced the [Chrome Web Store](http://chrome.google.com/webstore), an open marketplace for web apps.  
   
Google Chrome users who find web apps in the store will be able to create convenient shortcuts in Chrome for easy access. Also, developers will have the option to easily sell their apps through the store using a convenient and secure payment system.  
   
To give you a preview of what it means to prepare a web app for the store, we've published some [preliminary documentation](http://code.google.com/chrome/apps/). We look forward to your feedback and sharing our progress with you openly as many of the technical details will likely change before we launch. To stay up-to-date, subscribe to our [developer group](http://groups.google.com/a/chromium.org/group/chromium-apps/topics) and look for news on the [Chromium blog](http://blog.chromium.org).  
   
The Chrome Web Store will be available to users later this year. We plan to share more technical details soon. In the meantime, visit [chrome.google.com/webstore](http://chrome.google.com/webstore) for more information.
