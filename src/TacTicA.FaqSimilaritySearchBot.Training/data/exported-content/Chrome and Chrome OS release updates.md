We [previously paused](https://chromereleases.googleblog.com/2020/03/upcoming-chrome-and-chrome-os-releases.html)
upcoming releases for Chrome and Chrome OS. Today we’re sharing an update as
we’re now resuming releases with an adjusted schedule:

* M83 will be released three weeks earlier than previously planned and will include all M82 work as we cancelled the M82 release (all channels).
* Our Canary, Dev and Beta channels have or will resume this week, with M83 moving to Dev, and M81 continuing in Beta.
* Our Stable channel will resume release next week with security and critical fixes in M80, followed by the release of M81 the week of April 7, and M83 *~mid-May*.
* We will share a future update on the timing of the M84 branch and releases.

We continue to closely monitor that Chrome and Chrome OS are stable, secure,
and work reliably. We’ll keep everyone informed of any changes on our
schedule on our
[release blog](https://chromereleases.googleblog.com/)
and will share additional details on the schedule in the
[Chromium Developers group](https://groups.google.com/a/chromium.org/g/chromium-dev),
as needed. You can also check our
[schedule page](https://chromiumdash.appspot.com/schedule)
for specific dates for each milestone at any time.

Thanks everyone for the help and patience during this time.
