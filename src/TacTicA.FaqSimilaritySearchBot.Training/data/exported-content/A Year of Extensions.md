# A Year of Extensions
- **Published**: 2010-12-09T17:58:00.000-08:00
It’s hard to believe, but it’s already been a full year since we launched the Google Chrome extensions gallery.  
  
It’s been a busy twelve months:  

* The gallery has grown to over 8,500 extensions and 1,500 themes.
* A third of Chrome users have at least one extension installed.
* Over 70 million extensions and themes have been installed.

On the client side, we added features like:  

* New APIs for things like [context menus](http://code.google.com/chrome/extensions/contextMenus.html), [history](http://code.google.com/chrome/extensions/history.html), and [cookies](http://code.google.com/chrome/extensions/cookies.html).
* Integration between extensions and HTML5 features like [notifications](http://code.google.com/chrome/extensions/notifications.html) and [geolocation](http://code.google.com/chrome/extensions/manifest.html#geolocation).
* Extension sync, so your favorite extensions are always with you.
* Native support for Greasemonkey [user scripts](http://blog.chromium.org/2010/02/40000-more-extensions.html).

Looking forward, we’re very excited about the [Chrome Web Store](http://chrome.google.com/webstore), where developers will be able to easily sell their apps, extensions, and themes.  
  
And we’re not going to slow down on the features, either. The next Chrome release will add API support for the [omnibox](http://code.google.com/chrome/extensions/dev/omnibox.html) and [pinned tabs](http://code.google.com/chrome/extensions/dev/tabs.html#type-Tab). Beyond that, we’re hard at work on popular requests like [network interception](http://code.google.com/chrome/extensions/trunk/experimental.webRequest.html) and download management APIs, as well as new experimental APIs for [sidebars](http://code.google.com/chrome/extensions/trunk/experimental.sidebar.html) and development tools.  
  
Thanks for all your support over the last year, from bug reports to testing new APIs. It’s been a bit frantic at times, but mostly it’s been fun.
