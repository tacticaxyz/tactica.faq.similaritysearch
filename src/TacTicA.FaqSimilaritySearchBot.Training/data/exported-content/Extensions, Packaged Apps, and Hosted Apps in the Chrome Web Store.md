# Extensions, Packaged Apps, and Hosted Apps in the Chrome Web Store
- **Published**: 2010-09-27T08:10:00.000-07:00
We’re excited to see developer interest in the upcoming Chrome Web Store, particularly around installable web apps. Many of you have also asked about how extensions and apps differ, and how apps can leverage extension behavior.  
  
To answer these questions and more, we’ve published a [new article](http://code.google.com/chrome/webstore/articles/apps_vs_extensions.html) to help you decide between building extensions and building apps. In the article, you’ll read about how apps and extensions vary from the user’s perspective and how they compare in their internal architecture and capabilities. We’ve also included a deep dive on the concept of packaged apps as a blend of app and extension behaviour.  
  
We hope this [article](http://code.google.com/chrome/webstore/articles/apps_vs_extensions.html) helps clarify the distinction between pure extensions, packaged apps, and hosted apps so that you can choose the approach that makes the most sense for your work and your users. To learn more about installable webs apps and ask questions to our team, check out our [discussion group](http://groups.google.com/a/chromium.org/group/chromium-apps/topics). We look forward to getting your feedback!
