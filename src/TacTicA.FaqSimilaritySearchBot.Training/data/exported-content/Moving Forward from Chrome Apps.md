# Moving Forward from Chrome Apps
- **Published**: 2020-01-15T11:40:00.003-08:00
**Note: The timeline has been updated, please see our [October 2021 post](https://blog.chromium.org/2021/10/extending-chrome-app-support-on-chrome.html) for more details.**

The web platform has made substantial progress since the [launch](https://blog.chromium.org/2013/02/chrome-app-launcher-developer-preview.html) of Chrome Apps in 2013. As community members, we continue to work with other browsers and [invest](https://blog.chromium.org/2018/11/our-commitment-to-more-capable-web.html) to bring rich new capabilities to the platform, as seen in the announcements made at the Chrome Developer Summit last November.

The [progress](https://sites.google.com/a/chromium.org/dev/chrome-apps) of modern browsers puts the Web in a good position to answer the vast majority of use cases - evident in the success of companies like [Figma](https://www.figma.com/) and our own products like [Google Earth](https://g.co/earth/beta). We are confident that [the Web can deliver](https://blog.chromium.org/2019/11/making-new-experiences-possible-on-web.html) first class experiences on an open platform.

With this continued progress, we are expanding upon our [earlier announcement](https://developers.chrome.com/apps/about_apps) and will begin phasing out support for Chrome Apps across all operating systems as follows:

* **March 2020**: Chrome Web Store will stop accepting *new* Chrome Apps. Developers will be able to update existing Chrome Apps through June 2022.
* **June 2020**: End support for Chrome Apps on Windows, Mac, and Linux. Customers who have Chrome Enterprise and Chrome Education Upgrade will have access to a policy to extend support through December 2020.
* **December 2020**: End support for Chrome Apps on Windows, Mac, and Linux.
* **June 2021:** End support for NaCl, PNaCl, and PPAPI APIs.
* **June 2021**: End support for Chrome Apps on Chrome OS. Customers who have Chrome Enterprise and Chrome Education Upgrade will have access to a policy to extend support through June 2022.
* **June 2022**: End support for Chrome Apps on Chrome OS for all customers.

This change does not impact support for Chrome Extensions. Google will continue to support and invest in Chrome Extensions on all existing platforms. Fostering a robust ecosystem of extensions is critical to Chrome's mission and we are committed to providing a useful extension platform for customizing the browsing experience for all users.

For additional details (e.g., timelines, recommendations, a FAQ, etc.) please visit our [Chrome Apps migration site](https://developers.chrome.com/apps/migration). This page will be kept up to date as we progress together through this process.

On behalf of the Chrome team, we thank the community of developers for building great experiences using Chrome Apps and look forward to seeing similar experiences that leverage open Web standards (e.g., PWAs) across all modern browsers.
