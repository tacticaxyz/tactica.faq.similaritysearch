Games are some of the most popular apps on the web platform. Representatives from the Chrome team will be at the [Game Developers Conference](http://www.gdconf.com/), to connect with game developers and deliver tech talks on some of the latest web technologies.

On February 28th, as part of Google Developer Day at GDC, Vincent Scheib will present an overview of how the latest HTML5 technologies can be used to create games. On the same day, Gregg Tavares will explain how to get GPU-accelerated graphics with WebGL, and Bill Budge will show how you can program Web games in C++ using Native Client. For a full list of other Google talks check out [google.com/gdc2011](http://www.google.com/gdc2011).

We will also be present at Google’s booth on the GDC expo floor. Representatives from our 3D Graphics, Native Client, HTML5 and Chrome Web Store teams will be there to answer your questions on how you can use web technologies to create compelling games for Chrome’s 120+ million active users.

We can’t wait to see you there!
