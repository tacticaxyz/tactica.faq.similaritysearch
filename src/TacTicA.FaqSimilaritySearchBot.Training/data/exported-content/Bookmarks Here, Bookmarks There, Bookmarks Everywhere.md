# Bookmarks Here, Bookmarks There, Bookmarks Everywhere
- **Published**: 2009-08-17T17:15:00.000-07:00
As of today's [dev channel](http://dev.chromium.org/getting-involved/dev-channel) build, we're adding a brand new feature to Google Chrome: bookmark sync. Many users have several machines, one at home and one at work for example. This new feature makes it easy to keep the same set of bookmarks on all your machines, and stores them alongside your [Google Docs](http://docs.google.com/) for easy web access.

To activate this feature, launch Google Chrome with the --enable-sync command-line flag. Once you set up sync from the Tools menu, Chrome will then upload and store your bookmarks in your Google Account. Anytime you add or change a bookmark, your changes will be sent to the cloud and immediately broadcast to all other computers for which you've activated bookmark sync (using the same [XMPP](http://xmpp.org/) technology as [Google Talk](http://talk.google.com/)).

For more information on this, please see this email to [chromium-dev](http://groups.google.com/group/chromium-dev/browse_thread/thread/bdacc1bdf3c5cb6a?pli=1).

Happy syncing!
