# New features for the Chrome Web Store developer preview: Google Checkout integration & previewing for your apps
- **Published**: 2010-09-23T15:31:00.000-07:00
We’re excited to share with you some new features that we just added to the developer preview of the Chrome Web Store:  
  
Starting today, you can sign up for a Google Checkout merchant account via your developer dashboard. If you’re planning to use [Chrome Web Store Payments](http://code.google.com/chrome/webstore/docs/index.html#charging) to charge for apps, you’ll need to complete this setup before you can accept payments. If you already have a merchant account with Google Checkout, you’ll be able to associate it with your items in the store. Signing up for Chrome Web Store Payments is currently available to developers based in the US who have a US bank account. We’re working hard to also enable payments for international developers and will update you with a blog post once we have more details. If you have more questions about setting up your merchant account, see this [help article](http://www.google.com/support/chrome/bin/answer.py?answer=96832) we created.   
  
We also added the ability to see how your app will appear in the store. When you preview an uploaded app, you’ll see our new design of the app’s landing page. As before, your apps are only visible to you during the developer preview until the store launches later this year.   
  
We added several options to help you customize this page with your own header image and a larger icon. You can also upload promotional images for your app now, which will appear as banners whenever your app is featured in the store. To learn more about these new options, we encourage you to read our [guidelines](http://code.google.com/chrome/webstore/docs/images.html) about creating good images and icons for apps in the store.

We’ll continue to work on the web store design and add polish, but with today’s launch you can get your app’s landing page ready for the launch. For questions and feedback, we invite you to join our [developer discussion group](https://groups.google.com/a/chromium.org/group/chromium-apps/topics) and come back to the Chromium blog for more announcements about the Chrome Web Store.
