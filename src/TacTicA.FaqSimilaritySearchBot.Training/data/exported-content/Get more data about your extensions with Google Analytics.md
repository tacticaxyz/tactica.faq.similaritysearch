# Get more data about your extensions with Google Analytics
- **Published**: 2010-09-09T09:40:00.000-07:00
If you’re using the Google Chrome Extensions Gallery to publish your extensions, we just added support for [Google Analytics](http://www.google.com/analytics/), which can help you better understand how many people visit your extension pages, where they’re coming from and more.  
  
Starting today, you can specify a Google Analytics profile for each of your extensions. This will start tracking the extension’s page in your Google Analytics account as if that page was part of your own site. See these [instructions](http://www.google.com/support/chrome/bin/answer.py?answer=188739) for more information on how to set this up.

You can also use Google Analytics to track the usage of your extension once it’s installed. Check out this [tutorial](http://code.google.com/chrome/extensions/tut_analytics.html) that explains how to integrate Google Analytics such that you can analyze how users interact with the features of your extensions.  
  
For questions about this new feature, we encourage you to visit our [developer discussion group](https://groups.google.com/a/chromium.org/group/chromium-extensions/topics) and share your feedback with us.
