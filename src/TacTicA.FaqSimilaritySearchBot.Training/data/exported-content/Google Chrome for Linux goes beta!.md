# Google Chrome for Linux goes beta!
- **Published**: 2009-12-08T07:32:00.000-08:00
Google Chrome for Linux is finally ready for beta. Like the Windows version, it's [fast](http://blog.chromium.org/2009/12/technically-speaking-what-makes-google.html), [secure](http://dev.chromium.org/developers/core-principles), [stable](http://dev.chromium.org/developers/core-principles), [simple](http://dev.chromium.org/developers/core-principles), [extensible](https://chrome.google.com/extensions), and embraces open standards like [HTML5](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML5).  
  
But bringing Google Chrome to Linux wasn't just a straight port -- it was a labor of love. Google Chrome works well with both [Gnome](http://www.gnome.org/) and [KDE](http://kde.org/), and is updated via the normal system package manager. It has also been developed as a true open source project, using public [mailing lists](http://dev.chromium.org/developers/discussion-groups), IRC channels, bug tracker, code repository, and [continuous build and test farm](http://build.chromium.org/) -- following in large part the trail blazed by [Mozilla](http://www.mozilla.org/). Where we noticed problems in system libraries, we pushed fixes upstream and filed bugs. This open approach to development seems to be working: so far, about 50 developers outside Google have contributed code (for instance, [thanks to Ibrar and Pawe≈Ç for our FTP stack](http://blog.chromium.org/2009/09/new-ftp-implementation-goes-live.html)), and several Linux distributions even maintain preliminary open source builds of Google Chromium.  
  
In short, we really love Google Chrome for Linux, and we think you will, too[.](http://www.google.com/chrome/intl/en/w00t.html) Please try it and [let us know what you think](http://dev.chromium.org/for-testers/bug-reporting-guidelines).  
  
(One more thing: if you've already installed the dev channel version, you may need to uninstall that before installing the beta version -- we tried to make that work smoothly, but a few rough edges remain.)
