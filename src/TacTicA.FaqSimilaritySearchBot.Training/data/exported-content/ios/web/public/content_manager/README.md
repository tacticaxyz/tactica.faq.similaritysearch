This directory contains APIs to manage or block content.

The `ContentRuleListManager` is a public API through which the browser can
manage content rule lists to decide whether certain requests should be allowed,
denied, or modified before being executed. Rule lists are in WKContentRuleList
JSON format.

For more information on the JSON format see the official documentation.
