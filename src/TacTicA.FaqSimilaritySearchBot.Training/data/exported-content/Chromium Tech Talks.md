# Chromium Tech Talks
- **Published**: 2009-04-29T17:55:00.000-07:00
Since starting work at Google, I've formed a deep appreciation for the number of high quality talks we have access to here (both [technical](http://www.youtube.com/user/googletechtalks) and [not](http://www.youtube.com/user/AtGoogleTalks)). Reading code and documentation is pretty much unavoidable when you're a developer, but you really can't beat hearing directly from the expert's mouth on topics that you're interested in.

Last Wednesday, 5 Chromium experts gave mini tech talks on subjects ranging from the network stack to hacking on WebKit. Armed with 2 video cameras, a microphone, and a whiteboard, we did the best we could to capture these talks and make them available to Chromium developers around the world. Whether you're a seasoned Chromium contributor or just getting started, I think these videos have a lot to offer.

Here's a rundown of the videos:

[Darin Fisher](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0Z0ybTCHKs) talking about Chromium's multi-process architecture

[Brett Wilson](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IiN9fxwjcL0) talking about the various layers of Chromium

[Dimitri Glazkov](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QND2lFCrIGw) talking about hacking on WebKit

[Ben Goodger](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WsvNebq1dRg) talking about Views (and how to write good tests for them)

[Wan-Teh Chang and Eric Roman](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZhDb42M6ZLk) talking about Chromium's network stack (and its history)

I hope these are just the first of many tech talks we can offer to you, the Chromium community.
